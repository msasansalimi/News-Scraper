# News Scraper

## This web app let the users view and leave comments on the scraped news from NyTimes website.

### I have used express, express-handlebars, mongoose, cheerio, and axios to create this full-stack app and deployed on heroku.
### Whenever a user visits the site they are able to scrape and get title, summary and a link to that news, as well by clicking on any news they can leave a comment on the news and save it on a different page.
### As well I have created a delete button that user is able to delete their comment along with the news from the screen and mongodb as well.

### You can visit the complete web app [Here!](https://www.google.ca/)
