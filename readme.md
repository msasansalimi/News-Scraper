### I have used express, express-handlebars, mongoose, cheerio, and axios to create this full-stack app and deployed on heroku.

### Whenever a user visits the site they are able to scrape and get title, summary and a link to that news, as well by clicking on any news they can leave a comment on the news and save it on a different page.

### As well I have created a delete button that user is able to delete their comment along with the news from the screen and mongodb as well.
